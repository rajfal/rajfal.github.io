#### Historical, botanical and production background

Vetiver is a member of the Graminae grasses, historically harvested in India and Sri Lanka. Its specific scientific name is Vetiveria zizanioides. It is commonly known as ‘khus khus’, not to be confused with ‘couscous’.

Vetiver is a perennial grass that can reach up to five feet in height. The plant readily populates riverbanks and requires hot and humid environment to thrive. It can grow across the entire soil pH spectrum, displaying no preference for any, as long as it has full access to sun. Young plants can become stunted in the shade. This grass is characterised by the presence of extensive and deep root systems.

It is the undergrount plant parts, roots and rootless, that are the source of highly sought after oil since antiquity.  The vetiver oil is a complex essential oils, composed of several hundred of sesquiterpene derivatives that provide the benefits captured in perfume making, health restoration as well as an insect repellant.

Oil extraction begins with harvesting of 15-18 month old roots, usually around December and January. The roots are washed, sometimes dried, and subjected to steam distillation where they will yield a half to two percent of oil per weight of plant material.

Vetiver has a rejuvenating effect on skin, repairing the effect of dehydration, cuts, wounds, skin irritations and inflammations. It has been reported as a solution for persistent lower back pain (lumbago) and rheumatism.

2. Aromatic use

As an aromatic medium, the oil can be diffused through a diffuser or its aroma inhaled directly. Diffuser is helpful if you wish to have the oil droplets dispersed during your sleep at night. Whereas should you be needing the grounding effect of vetiver during daytime, then perhaps carry a small 2-5ml bottle of the oil with you to inhale it directly. Vetiver assists in overcoming depression, insomnia, inability to enter deep sleep, anxiety, stress or tension.

Vetiver is known to improve the functioning of the parathyroid gland. This set of four tiny glands control uptake and release of calcium. Releasing parathyroid hormone (PTH), they can control the blood calcium levels through a number of mechanisms:
- releasing calcium from bones into blood
- improving body’s uptake of calcium from food
- improving kidney’s ability to capture calcium instead of letting it pass out with urine

Proper calcium balance is crucial to correct function of the heart, nervous system, kidneys and bones.
