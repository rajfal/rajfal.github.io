I have 15+ years experience in relational database modeling & design, data imports-exports, data migration across industries such as electrical, gas and water utilities, insurance, health, mining and agricultural and energy trading sectors.

I enjoy extracting, transforming and analysing recordsets from a variety of data sources such as relational databases, text files and documents. When converting raw business data into tabular datasets I deliver data that maintains integrity and accuracy.

One of my key strengths is posing questions that uncover what drives business systems and the people using them. 

#####However, #####
... as of early 2017, I left the Relational world for good and I ventured out into the world of Connected semantic databases and graphs.

The technology I am exploring right now is Neo4j, and hence this is what Graphspace is all about.

Enjoy!
