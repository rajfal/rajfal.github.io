![Graph Data Engineer :)](/assets/images/rmj_mini_photo_.jpg)
    
I have 15+ years experience in relational database modeling & design, data imports-exports, data migration across industries such as electrical, gas and water utilities, insurance, health, mining and agricultural and energy trading sectors.

I enjoy extracting, transforming and analysing recordsets from a variety of data sources such as relational databases, text files and documents. When converting raw business data into tabular datasets I deliver data that maintains integrity and accuracy.

One of my key strengths is posing questions that uncover what drives business systems and the people using them. 

However, I left the Relational world to venture out into the universe of Connected semantic databases and graphs.

<b>The technology I am exploring is **_Neo4j_**, and hence this is what ****Graph*{: style="color: red"}****space** is all about.</b>

Enjoy!
